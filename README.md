# Grail

GrailGUI is a prototype of a replacement for web programming (HTTP, HTML, CSS,
JavaScript) and GUI programming. It includes a client graphical API, a browser
implemented in C++ and OpenGL, a protocol to transmit metadata and data in
binary, a language (XDL) to describe the binary data, and local storage to
retain data on the client should that be necessary. Encrypted communications
(equivalent of TLS) have not yet been implemented.

## Our Contributions
Juan and I have worked on the Multishape and Chess experimentation branch found [here](https://github.com/athakkar1/GrailGUI/tree/Chess%2BMultishape2D_Experimentation).

A writeup of our work can be found on my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-thakkar-554721229/overlay/experience/2047382212/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADk8z9ABdtGzph6DuE_pCyk9JRQy7MaEv5c&treasuryMediaId=1635503595642).

The chess game using Grail is a work in progress, and we hope to implement server functionality and Stockfish soon! Below is a video of our game in action (ran on my VM, sorry for the poor framerate):
